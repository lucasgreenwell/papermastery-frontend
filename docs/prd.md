Product Requirements Document (PRD): ArXiv Mastery Platform
Project Name: ArXiv Mastery Platform

Domain: papermastery.com (tentative)

Version: 1.0

1. Overview
1.1 Problem Statement
Academic papers on arXiv are often dense, jargon-heavy, and assume significant prior knowledge, making them challenging for many readers to understand. Existing tools provide summarization or simplification but lack a structured, engaging, and step-by-step learning experience.

1.2 Solution
The ArXiv Mastery Platform transforms arXiv papers into personalized, interactive learning experiences. By leveraging the arXiv API, it fetches paper content and metadata, breaks it into tiered learning levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced), integrates multimedia, and employs gamification to enhance user engagement.

2. Key Features
2.1 Paper Submission and Processing
Input: Users submit an arXiv link (e.g., https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10389).
Processing:
Fetch metadata (title, authors, abstract) and full text using the arXiv API.
Generate tiered summaries with AI tools:
Beginner: Simplified, jargon-free overview.
Intermediate: Key points with explained technical terms.
Advanced: Detailed summary with technical depth.
Segment the paper into 4-7 logical sections (e.g., Introduction, Methods) using NLP-based parsing.
Identify related papers and prerequisites via OpenAlex and Connected Papers APIs.
2.2 Personalized Learning Path
Structure:
Beginner Level: Simplified chunks, Anki flashcards, and basic quizzes.
Intermediate Level: Explained chunks, Paper Q&A interactions, and intermediate quizzes.
Advanced Level: Full technical chunks, Research Paper Summarizer slides, and advanced quizzes.
Sequencing: Begins with prerequisite concepts from related papers, then progresses through the target paper’s tiers.
Dynamic Adjustment: Adapts content based on user interactions via Paper Q&A and AI assistants.
2.3 Gamification and Progress Tracking
Points and Badges: Earn points for completing quizzes, flashcards, and sections; unlock badges for milestones (e.g., “Beginner Master”).
Progress Bar: Shows mastery percentage for each paper, updated with user actions.
Knowledge Map: Visualizes covered topics and remaining areas, linking chunks to learning steps.
2.4 Interactive Q&A and Feedback
AI Assistant: Allows users to ask questions about the paper (e.g., “What’s a neural network?”) with real-time responses from Paper Q&A.
Personalized Feedback: Offers detailed explanations and hints for incorrect quiz answers.
2.5 Multimedia Integration
YouTube Videos: Embeds relevant tutorials for each learning step (e.g., “Basics of Calculus” for a math paper).
Time-to-Mastery: Estimates and displays the time required to master the paper, based on content complexity and average learning speed.
2.6 User Dashboard
Main Page: Includes a form to submit an arXiv link and a list of previously submitted papers with mastery status.
Paper Details Page: Displays summaries, learning path, quizzes, flashcards, progress bar, and a graph of related papers.
3. User Journey
Sign In/Register: User logs in or registers on the main page.
Submit Paper: User enters an arXiv link on the main page.
Processing:
A “Preparing your learning path” loading screen appears while the system fetches and processes the paper via the arXiv API.
Initial skill level starts at 0%.
Summary and Confirmation:
The Paper Details Page displays the beginner summary.
User confirms reading it, increasing skill level (e.g., by 5%).
Quiz and Feedback:
A short quiz tests comprehension.
Correct answers boost skill level; incorrect answers provide feedback and hints.
Contextual Graph:
A graph of related papers (via Connected Papers) enables exploration of prerequisites and extensions.
Learning Path:
User progresses through beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels with tailored chunks, flashcards, quizzes, and videos.
Mastery:
Completing sections and quizzes updates the progress bar and awards points/badges.
User achieves 100% mastery upon finishing the advanced level.
4. Unique Value Propositions
Foundational Learning: Builds knowledge from prerequisites, unlike tools that only summarize.
Gamified Engagement: Points, badges, and progress tracking make learning rewarding.
Interactive Personalization: Real-time Q&A and tailored feedback enhance understanding.
Time-to-Mastery Insight: Offers a clear effort estimate for planning.
Holistic Experience: Combines text, flashcards, quizzes, slides, and videos.
5. Competitors and Differentiation
Competitors: Alphaxiv, Explainpaper.
Differentiation:
Comprehensive learning paths from foundational concepts.
Gamification and multimedia for engagement.
Dynamic AI-driven Q&A and feedback.
