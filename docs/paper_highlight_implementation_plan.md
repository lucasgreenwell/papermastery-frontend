Frontend Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Enhance the PDF Viewer Component
Objective: Add interactive options to the PDF viewer’s tooltip.
Steps:
Update the PDF viewer component to display a tooltip with "Summarize" and "Explain" buttons when text is highlighted.
Capture the highlighted text using the existing PDF highlighting mechanism.
Phase 2: Handle User Interactions
Objective: Respond to user actions and prepare data for backend calls.
Steps: 3. Add click handlers for the "Summarize" and "Explain" buttons in the tooltip. 4. Store the highlighted text and the selected action (summarize or explain) in the component’s state.
Phase 3: API Integration
Objective: Link the frontend to the backend endpoints.
Steps: 5. Create service functions to call the backend’s summarization and explanation endpoints, passing the paper ID and highlighted text. 6. Integrate these functions into the PDF viewer, triggering them based on button clicks.
Phase 4: Display Results
Objective: Present the backend responses to the user.
Steps: 7. Add a display area (e.g., a modal or inline section) in the PDF viewer to show the summary or explanation. 8. Update the component state with the backend response and render it in the display area.
Phase 5: User Feedback and Error Handling
Objective: Enhance usability with clear feedback.
Steps: 9. Show a loading indicator while waiting for the backend response. 10. Display an error message if the API call fails or returns an issue.
Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
Objective: Ensure reliability and performance.
Steps: 11. Write unit tests for the updated PDF viewer component, focusing on tooltip behavior and API integration. 12. Write integration tests to verify the end-to-end flow from highlighting to result display. 13. Optimize the PDF viewer to remain responsive, especially with large documents, by minimizing performance impacts.

Backend Implementation Plan
Phase 1: API Endpoint Development
Objective: Create new endpoints to process summarization and explanation requests.
Steps:
Add two POST endpoints to the existing API routes file:
One endpoint for summarizing highlighted text, tied to a specific paper (e.g., /papers/{paper_id}/summarize).
One endpoint for explaining highlighted text, also tied to a specific paper (e.g., /papers/{paper_id}/explain).
Define a request model with a field for the highlighted text to standardize input data.
Verify the paper ID exists using existing paper validation logic before processing requests.
Phase 2: Integration with AI Services
Objective: Connect the endpoints to AI-driven summarization and explanation capabilities.
Steps: 4. Extend the summarization service to include a function that processes highlighted text into a concise summary. 5. Extend the language model service to include a function that generates an explanation for the highlighted text. 6. Reuse existing prompt templates for summarization and create a new template for explanation if needed.
Phase 3: Data Processing
Objective: Ensure the highlighted text is properly prepared and formatted.
Steps: 7. Preprocess the highlighted text (e.g., remove extra spaces, handle empty inputs) before sending it to AI services. 8. Apply prompt rendering to insert the highlighted text into the appropriate templates. 9. Postprocess the AI-generated output to ensure it’s clean and suitable for frontend display.
Phase 4: Error Handling and Logging
Objective: Make the system robust and trackable.
Steps: 10. Add error handling for invalid paper IDs, missing text, or AI service failures using existing exception mechanisms. 11. Implement logging for requests, responses, and errors in both the summarization and explanation functions.
Phase 5: Scalability and Performance
Objective: Optimize the backend for efficiency.
Steps: 12. Use asynchronous processing for AI service calls to handle multiple requests concurrently. 13. Consider caching responses for frequently requested text to reduce AI service load.
Phase 6: Testing and Documentation
Objective: Validate functionality and inform developers/users.
Steps: 14. Write unit tests for the new summarization and explanation functions. 15. Write integration tests for the new endpoints to ensure end-to-end functionality. 16. Update API documentation with details of the new endpoints and their usage.
